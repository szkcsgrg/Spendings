**New Features:**

* **Customizable Spending Categories:** You now have more control over your spending view! In the settings panel, you can hide and show existing spending categories to personalize your experience.

**Improvements:**

* **Data Accuracy:** We've resolved an issue that caused data retrieval problems. Your financial information should now be displayed accurately.
* **Login Enhancements:** Using different login providers (like Google or Github) with the same email address should now work seamlessly.
* **UI Refinements:** We've made some minor adjustments to improve the app's visual alignment and overall look.
* **Security Update:** We've implemented a security improvement to better protect your data.

**Known Issues:**
