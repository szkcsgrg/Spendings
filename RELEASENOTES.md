## Spendings App - Release Notes

### Version <span style="color: #f9b17a;">1.2.4</span> (Release Date: 2024-07-01)

**New Features:**

* **Enhanced Payment Tracking within Currency Profiles:** We've completely revamped how you manage spending within your currency profiles. Now, you can assign each transaction to a specific payment method, like cash or card, providing a more granular view of your finances.
* **Improved Spending Type Selection:** Selecting spending types is now even more convenient. Simply press the escape button on your keyboard to close the selection menu when entering a new expense.
* **Streamlined UI Refresh:** We've implemented a significant UI redesign, making the app more user-friendly and professional. Based on user research, this update provides a more visually appealing and intuitive experience.

**Improvements:**

* **Previous Month Income Accuracy:** Fixed a bug that caused inaccurate updates to previous month income data.
* **Simplified Single-Currency Exchange:** Resolved an issue where users with only one currency profile were prompted to select an account when trying to exchange currencies. The app will now prompt you to either create a new currency profile or directly add the exchange value as a spending entry.

**Bug Fixes:**

* **Fixed a minor bug related to closing the spending type selection menu.**  (This can be merged with the improvement section for a cleaner look)

**Known Issues:**

* **Temporary Login Experience:** Due to recent changes by Firebase, we've implemented a temporary login method ("loginPopUp") on mobile devices. This might occasionally lead to error messages. We're actively working on a permanent solution and will keep you updated.

**Upcoming Features:**

* Budgeting Support: Set spending limits and stay on track with your financial goals. (Details coming soon!)
* Enhanced Security: Rest assured, your data is protected with strong security measures. We'll be providing more details about these measures in a future update.
* Customizable Interface: Take control of your app experience! A future update will allow you to toggle specific UI elements on or off to personalize your view.
* Detailed Reports: Gain deeper insights into your finances with the upcoming report generation feature. Generate reports for a comprehensive financial analysis.
* Focus on User Comfort: We're continuously working on improving the user experience. Stay tuned for additional features designed to make managing your finances even easier.
* More Login Options: We're exploring the possibility of adding more login options beyond Google and Github to provide greater flexibility in the future.
